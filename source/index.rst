Dalton's Blog
=============
Hi there! My name is Dalton Smith and I'm a developer of many things. Currently I volunteer with `WPILib <https://github.com/wpilibsuite/>`__ where I maintain their documentation. I also write several `Sphinx <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/>`__ extensions. I consider myself proficient in Python and Java, and always love tackling new and exciting challenges.

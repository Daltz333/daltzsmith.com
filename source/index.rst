   Hello, I'm your host, Dalton Smith. Welcome to my lonely lonely site, where I (hopefully) document my various adventures in the amateur world. The goal is to write articles on a bunch of random stuff. This can range from documentation |:writing_hand:| with `Sphinx <https://sphinx-doc.org>`__ and rants |:angry:| on some of my favorite anime.
